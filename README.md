### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Seele.Clover. Luckly you can find my github page.

To my mind, I am a programmer, a designer and a philosopher. Welcome to discuss these issues to me.

Now I am studying for my bachelor degree of Computer Science (Database) in the university.


###### Seele.Clover was not just a storyteller, he was a story. And story is resilient, protean, eternal.
